- [ ] Use the python [Natural Language Toolkit](http://www.nltk.org/) on data from file that is submitted.
      Analyze sentiment to show user context of the words they searched in each appearance
- [ ] Implement stemming and allow regex in searches 
- [ ] Experiment with n-grams for the inverted index
